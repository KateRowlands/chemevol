Chemevol - Python package to read in a star formation history file, 
input galaxy parameters and run chemical evolution to determine the evolution
of gas, metals and dust in galaxies.  

The code is based on Morgan & Edmunds 2003 (MNRAS, 343, 427) 
and described in detail in Rowlands et al 2014 (MNRAS, 441, 1040).   

If you use this code, please do cite the above papers.

First set up initial parameters for galaxy model
- initial gas mass in solar masses
- filename for star formation history file (filename.sfh)
- power law if using SFH generated by MAGPHYS code (gamma) 
- choice of IMF function: Chab, TopChab, kroup or Salp
- choice of dust sources to be included: 
	supernova (SN)
	low intermediate mass stars (LIMS)
	grain growth (GG)
- dust destruction from SN shocks on or off
- inflows - parameterized by X * SFR
- outflows - parameterized by X * SFR
